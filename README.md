# Fallout.css

CSS styles for Fallout-based websites!

Just copy the CSS file `fallout.css` into your project and link it in your HTML file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fallout.css">
```

And you're good to go!

## Some things to note

- I use TailwindCSS for the CSS reset and utility classes, so you might see some classes that you don't recognize.
- The trademark Fallout is owned by Bethesda Softworks LLC. This is a fan project and is not affiliated with Bethesda Softworks LLC.
- Any feedback is appreciated! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
